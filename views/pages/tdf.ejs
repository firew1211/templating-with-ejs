    <p>The Tigray Defence Forces (TDF) are a military structure that came into existence during the Tigray War. They consist of a merger of the Special Forces of the Tigray Regional government, soldiers that have defected from the Ethiopian National Defense Force, local militia, members of Tigrayan political parties such as the TPLF, National Congress of Great Tigray, Salsay Weyane Tigray, Tigray Independence Party and others together with numerous youth who fled to the mountains.</p>
    <p> The Emergence of the Tigray Defence Forces (TDF) As the genocidal intentions of the invading forces became evident in the widespread destruction and massacres committed against Tigrayan civilians, the Tigray Defense Force emerged (TDF) as an army of the people. In addition to Tigray’s trained forces, all who were able to join did — from high school to college students, professors, business owners, and survivors of the violence — as they were left with no other choice. They had to defend their people and region from the indiscriminate killings and criminal intentions of ethnic cleansing by the Abiy Ethiopian regime, Amhara expansionists, and Eritrea’s dictator Isaias Afwerki. </p>
    <p>Within weeks, the TDF drove out the ENDF, EDF, and Amhara special forces and militia from most of Tigray, including the entire Southern region of Tigray annexed by Amhara expansionists at the beginning of the genocidal war. However, much of Western Tigray is still under the control of Amhara forces supported by Ethiopian and Eritrean forces.</p>
    <p>Of all the progress the TDF has made, most remarkable are the TDF’s ethics, discipline, humanity, and fighting spirit. Considering  the vast majority of the fighters have lost family members during this war and that some have witnessed their family and friends being executed or brutally sexually assaulted, the way the TDF treats POWs is admirable. </p>
